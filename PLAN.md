# PLAN for Spotify Music Review App (Phase 1: Search Feature)

## Problem Statement
We want to build a mobile-native music review app similar to Letterboxd, but for music. For the initial phase, we're focusing on implementing just the search functionality that connects to Spotify's API. The app will have a simple search bar that allows users to search for music on Spotify, and display the results in a list. This serves as a foundation for the larger review platform we'll build later.

## Technical Requirements
- Flutter for cross-platform mobile development
- Spotify Web API for music search functionality
- Simple UI with search bar and results list
- No authentication required yet (will use client credentials flow)

## Atomic Development Chunks

### Chunk 1: Project Setup
- Create a new Flutter project
- Configure project structure
- Add necessary dependencies to pubspec.yaml
  - http package for API calls
  - spotify_sdk or a similar package if needed
  - Any UI packages needed for design

### Chunk 2: Spotify API Configuration
- Register the app on Spotify Developer Dashboard
- Obtain API credentials
- Create a configuration file to store API keys
- Implement client credentials authentication flow
- Set up API base URL and endpoints
- Come up with a method for simpler API calls (abstract away the details of the token retrieval and checking, maybe behind a 'requests' class or something. Talk to claude)

### Chunk 3: Create Data Models
- Create data models for Spotify search results
- Implement model classes for:
  - Track
  - Album
  - Artist
  - Search result container

### Chunk 4: Spotify API Service
- Create an API service class
- Implement method to fetch access token
- Create search method that takes query string
- Handle API responses and error cases
- Convert JSON responses to model objects

### Chunk 5: Search Input UI
- Design search bar UI component
- Implement input field with proper styling
- Add search icon and clear button
- Implement input state management
- Handle keyboard events (Enter key)

### Chunk 6: Search Results UI
- Create UI for displaying search results
- Design list item layout for search results
- Implement loading state indicator
- Handle empty results state
- Design error state display

### Chunk 7: Connect Search UI to API Service
- Connect search input actions to API calls
- Implement debounce for search queries
- Display loading indicator during API calls
- Update UI with search results
- Handle pagination if needed

### Chunk 8: Result Item Detail View
- Implement tap behavior on search results
- Create basic detail view for selected items
- Display more information about the selected item
- Add back navigation

### Chunk 9: UI Polish and Error Handling
- Improve visual design
- Add animations for smoother UX
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add retry mechanisms for failed requests
- Ensure proper keyboard handling

### Chunk 10: Testing
- Write unit tests for API service
- Create widget tests for search functionality
- Test error scenarios
- Implement integration tests for the search flow

## Next Phase Considerations (Not part of current plan)
- User authentication with Spotify
- Saving search history
- Implementing review functionality
- Social features

This plan outlines the step-by-step process to build a simple Spotify search feature in Flutter. Each chunk represents a small, testable unit of work that builds upon the previous ones to create a functional search feature.
